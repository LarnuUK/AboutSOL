## Question
I've recently visited Chat, specifically the [Stack Overflow Lobby](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/259507/stack-overflow-lobby), however, I was unfamiliar with the rules and expectations of the chat room. Does the Lobby follow the same rules as Stack Overflow, and I must ask Programming/Software engineering questions, or is it more open? Can I ask about my Stack Overflow itself, or other sites in the network? Are there different rules there that don't exists in the Q&A area of the site? Are the a definitive set of rules?


## Answer
The [Stack Overflow Lobby](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/259507/stack-overflow-lobby) (SOL) (alongside the [Stack Exchange Lobby](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/158962/stack-exchange-lobby) (SEL)) was created by Stack Overflow Inc. Admittedly, guidance from the company expected usage has been limited, so the respective communities have taken this on board a little to try and direct the 2 rooms in a direction that fits them. Please note that this answer is specifically about the SOL, and guidelines about the SEL may differ.

### Topics
There's no set topic in the SOL, it's not *specifically* about Stack Overflow (SO) for example. That, however, doesn't mean that "anything goes", and topics should mostly be central to what SO is about, or about SO itself. Conversations can still be friendly and we don't discourage banter nor completely off-topic conversation per say, however, it's also not the best place to ask "how do I bake a cake?", or "How do I fix my broken bike wheel?"; if you arrive in chat and immediately start asking questions that aren't really Stack Overflow related you're more likely to be referred to a different community. 

Coding questions are allowed, however, bear in mind that Chat isn't well designed for in-depth Q&A. If you have a short coding question, and can provide a small code snippet, or error, to compliment that question then it is more likely to be well received in the chat. Please do start your problem by *explaining* it first, and then provide the relevant code/error(s). Asking a question, followed by a very large block of code, or where the a lot of back and worth between you and other members of the chat is likely to end up less successful; for longer problems consider creating a question or create and/or inviting the users to a different room for indepth discussions.

Code and error dumps, without any explanation or context, are disruptive to the chat, so these will most likely be removed and thus you won't get help on the issue. Remember to explain the problem *first*.

### Conversation
Like mentioned above, there isn't a set topic in the SOL, so if things do move to off-topic conversation naturally, then that's fine. We welcome a friendly and welcoming environment. Please ensure that you are courteous to your fellow chat users. Use *inclusive terms* when referring to others, and treat others like human beings; don't send a message that looks like your trying to prompt an LLM/AI for an answer as these are often poorly received. Such messages may also be removed.

Messages *must* be in [English](https://stackoverflow.com/help/non-english-questions); content not in English will be removed. Messages that contain nonsense will also be removed.

If you ask a question, and you've not got a response, please don't feel you need to resend the message again shortly afterwards; the lobby can be quite busy at times, or very quiet. Sending the same mesasge repeatedly is more likely to result in your latter messagea being removed; if you aren't getting an answer in caht then perhaps you should be using the Q&A part of the site, where your question will more likely be seen by SMEs and also will have more "resilience". (If you haven't yet, please remember to read the [tour](//stackoverflow.com/tour) before posting your question.)

If you are psoting a code block, please also make sure to use the "fixed font" button. After pasting your (multi-line) code into the text box, a fixed font button will appear; click this to make your message be send more like code. For some language (such as Python) this is especially impportant.

### Starring
Chat has a "star" feature. Though this is like a "like" feature it means that the message will be displayed for *all* users in a more prominant position.As such we ask that users star messages that are truly useful to both you, and others. Stars are often cleaned by the ROs in the SOL when such messages are starred. If someone says "Hi" to you, please don't use the star feature to say "hi" back; starring a message doesn't notify the user that sent the message in any way.

### Moderation
The SOL is mostly moderated by the Room Owners (ROs); their names appear in *italics*. Staff and moderators do sometimes visit the room as well, who in addition to showing their name in *italics* have a diamond (â™¦) adjacent to their name and their username will be a pale blue (differnt to the visited link blue). Please do adhere to the advice of these users; failure to do so may result in you being kicked from the SOL. Repeated kicks will result in you being unable to reenter the Lobby for a period of time.

If you notice a message that you feel breaks the [Code of Conduct](https://stackoverflow.com/conduct), please use the flag system. For example, if a user has entered and is advertising their website, you should flag this. Once the message has enough flags it will automatically be deleted and further action(s) may be taken against the user. If you feel a user is being disruptive, but isn't breaking the Code of Conduct you can ping one, or more, of the ROs, and if they are available they will be able to take action.
